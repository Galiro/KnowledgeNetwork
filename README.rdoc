== Mycelial: A Project-Based Community for Makers

Problem: We all have varied interests but there is no place to stash all of our projects, and no way to show how interesting our lives truly are. A resume is formal and boring and generally excludes a lot of cool stuff that we do. 

Solution: Post your blog posts, code, designs, writing, DIY, inventions, and any other project on a Mycelial page. You can also promote your projects and cross-pollinate them with other people's projects.
