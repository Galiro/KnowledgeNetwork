<p>Hi,</p> 

<p>Thank you for trying out Mycelial! I would love to get your feedback about the app. Feel free to send me an email (just reply to this email) at any time and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible.</p>

<p>You can post any type of project on Mycelial. It's a portfolio for your entire life, really. A page like this is not only a really interesting way to display your accomplishments, but I believe it is a better way of advertising yourself for a new job. After all, nobody likes reading a bulleted list on a Resume anymore.</p>

<p>The other great benefit of Mycelial is you can promote your projects by tagging them. Every project with tags is related to other similar projects via the Sporeprint page. This is a good way to discover projects with similar DNA.</p>

<p>Thanks again for trying it out! You can also get in touch with me by tweeting me anytime @mycelial.</p>

<p>Cheers,<p>

<p>Damian</p>
