Hi, 

Thank you for trying out Mycelial! I would love to get your feedback about the app. Feel free to send me an email (just reply to this email) at any time and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible. 

Remember, you can post any type of project on Mycelial. It's a portfolio for your entire life, really. A page like this is not only a really interesting way to display your accomplishments, but I believe it is a better way of advertising yourself for a new job. After all, nobody likes reading a bulleted list on a Resume anymore. 

If you want to get in contact with me personally, just send an email to damian@mycelial.com. I'd love to hear from you. 

Cheers,

Damian
